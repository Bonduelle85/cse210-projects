We don’t always find time to train, and when we have time, 
it’s difficult for us to organize our training on our own.
This program will help you organize your workouts.

You can create your own training schedule, which consists of three days. 
You can fill out each of the three days with workouts and then save them to a file 
so you can come back later and remember which exercises you didn’t do.

There are different types of exercises: some take into account the time, 
others the number of repetitions. 
This program offers 4 types of exercises:
1. Exercises with repetitions. 
Typically contain 10-30 repetitions and 1-3 sets.
2. Timed exercises. 
For example running. You can run for 15-30 minutes.
3. Timed exercises with approaches. 
For example, a plank stand. You can do planks 3 times for 2 (180 seconds) minutes.
4. There is a custom exercise with a description.

Main menu options:
1. Create Exercise. 
Here we create a workout and include it in one of the days.

2. Show All Exercises. 
This menu item displays all three days and all exercises. 
It also shows how many exercises we have done in whole or in part.

3. Do Exercise. 
In this menu item, you perform a workout 
(if it is a short workout, for example, a plank stand) 
or mark the fact of completing the workout if it is 
a long workout (for example, Running). You also 
choose which day's exercise you do.

4. Load Exercises. 
Workouts saved to a file can be loaded before starting exercises.

5.Save Exercises.
Please note that the program will lose your workout 
data once it exits, so you must save it. 
This item will save all workouts at once into 3 corresponding files.

6. Quit.
Exit the application.
